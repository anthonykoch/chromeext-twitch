# SafeTwitch

The extension does the following:

- Links will still show up in chat, but clicking them won't open the link. The only way to open a link would be to explicitly right click and select "open link in new tab". 

- Mutes the front page and creative pages of twitch because of the auto-playing video. 


## Note

I don't plan on putting this extension on the Chrome store.
